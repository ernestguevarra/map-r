The aim of the exercise is for you to become familiar with the use of R in handling shapefile datasets. By this time, you have already learned how to issue a command to retrieve a standard or typical dataset using the read.table() function For this exercise, we will use the readOGR() function provided by the rgdal package to retrieve shapefile dateset. First, we need to install and load the rgdal package. install.packages(“rgdal”) library(rgdal) We can now try to read the Sudan shapefile. To do this however, we need to have an orientation on what shapefiles are. A shapefile is a digital vector storage format for storing geometric location and associated attribute information. This format lacks the capacity to store topological information. The shapefile format was initially developed for proprietary use with ArcView GIS version 2 in the early 1990s. It is now possible to read and write shapefiles using a variety of programs including data analysis software such as R. Shapefiles are simple because they store the primitive geometric data types of points, lines, and polygons. They are of limited use without any attributes to specify what they represent. Therefore, a table of records will store properties/attributes for each primitive shape in the shapefile. Shapes (points/lines/polygons) together with data attributes can create infinitely many representations about geographic data. Representation provides the ability for powerful and accurate computations. While the term “shapefile” is quite common, a shapefile is actually a set of several files. Three individual files are mandatory to store the core data that comprise a shapefile: .shp .shx .dbf The actual shapefile relates specifically to .shp files but alone is incomplete for distribution, as the other supporting files are required.
